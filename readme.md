# My Plant Planner

## Description
This website is a resource for individuals seeking to take care of their houseplants. The homepage features a user-friandly layout with information about plants, embedded YouTube videos, and easy-to-navigate tabs linking to "My Plants" and "Explore" pages. The "My Plants" section allows the user to keep a catalogue of their plants using local storage. In the "Explore" page, the user can look up plants to learn more about them. This website provides a useful platform for plant enthusiasts to expand their knowledge and cultivate thriving indoor plants. 

## How to use
Our website lets you explore and search from a variety of indoor plants. If you have any plants from the explore section, you can add them to your favorites as follows:
Click on explore
Load any data that is being asked to continue. You only have to do this once.
Search for an indoor plant by browsing between pages, or use the search bar if you already know the name.
Click on the heart button to add that plant to favorites.
To see your favorite plants, click on My Plants.

## NOTE - API
The current API used to generate this plant data is with perenual.com. Some of their plant data files are missing information; there will be some minor issues with loading the data into the site. This could be fixed if this project is updated and built with its own database to pull from or finding a better API to get data from.
